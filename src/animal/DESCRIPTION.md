# **Animal**
************

Create a **class Animal**, which holds two fields:

   > - name: String
   > - favouriteFood: String
    
**Animal has one abstract method explainSelf\(): String**.

You should add two new **classes - Cat and Dog**. **Override the explainSelf\()** method by adding concrete animal sound on a new line. \(Look at examples below)

You should be able to use the class like this:

````java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal cat = new Cat("Oscar", "Whiskas");
        Animal dog = new Dog("Rocky", "Meat");
        System.out.println(cat.explainSelf());
        System.out.println(dog.explainSelf());

    }
}
````

**Examples**

| Input	| Output |
| --- | --- |
|| I am Oscar and my favourite food is Whiskas |
|| MEEOW |
|| I am Rocky and my favourite food is Meat |
|| DJAAF |
